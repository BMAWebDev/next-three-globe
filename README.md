# Next Three Globe

## About

A NextJS project built with ThreeJS. Takes a list of partners and lists them either in a grid view or in a global view, switchable with a button. The globe is rendered with the help of ThreeJS's WebGL Renderer + some other goodies. Take a look while you're at it.

Disclaimer: code inspiration + help on shaders part from [here](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/globe-with-markers-and-label-thoughts-ideas-approaches-solutions/34995).
